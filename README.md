- **Business Problem:** Netflix wants to gather useful insights on their shows and movies for their subscribers through their datasets. The issue is, they are working with too much data (approximately 82k rows of data combined) and are unsure how to effectively analyze and extract meaningful insights from it. They need a robust and scalable data analytics solution to handle the vast amount of data and uncover valuable patterns and trends.

- **How I Plan On Solving the Problem:** In helping Netflix gather valuable insights from their extensive movies and shows dataset, I will be utilizing SQL to extract relevant information, and conduct insightful analyses. By leveraging SQL's functions, I can uncover key metrics such as viewer ratings, popularity trends, genre preferences, and viewership patterns.

An IMDB score is a widely recognized measure of the overall quality and popularity of a movie or show. The top 10 movies and shows stood out for their exceptional IMDB scores, indicating that they are highly regarded by viewers. These titles have likely garnered significant acclaim and positive reviews, contributing to their high rankings within the Netflix library. Viewers who are seeking quality content would find these selections very appealing. On the other hand, the bottom 10 movies and shows had lower IMDB scores. While these entries may not have resonated as strongly with audiences, it's important to note that many factors influence these rankings such as individual preferences, weak plot, poor acting, and low-quality production. By uncovering the top and bottom performers based on IMDB scores, this project sheds light on the varying levels of audience reception and highlights titles that are likely to be well-received and those that may have room for improvement. These findings can provide valuable insights for viewers seeking highly-rated content and can serve as a basis for further analysis and decision-making for Netflix's audience recommendations. 

## 2. How many movies and shows fall in each decade in Netflix's library?
```mysql
SELECT CONCAT(FLOOR(release_year / 10) * 10, 's') AS decade,
	COUNT(*) AS movies_shows_count
FROM shows_movies.titles
WHERE release_year >= 1940
GROUP BY CONCAT(FLOOR(release_year / 10) * 10, 's')
ORDER BY decade;
```

The results of the SQL query provide a fascinating insight into the distribution of movies and shows across different decades in Netflix's library. The data reveals a significant shift in content availability over time, with a notable increase in the number of titles from the 2000s onwards. Starting from the earlier decades, the 1940s-1980s showcase a small fraction of the total entries, suggesting that Netflix's collection from these decades is relatively limited. The 1990s demonstrate a large surge in offerings, with 121 titles. However, the true turning point in Netflix's library occurs in the 2010s with a remarkable 3,304 movies and shows from this decade. This abundance highlights Netflix's dedication to featuring contemporary content that aligns with current trends and audience preferences.

Even though the 2020s are still in progress, the dataset reveals an impressive count of 1,972 movies and shows, indicating a strong focus on acquiring and producing content from recent years. Overall, these findings shed light on Netflix's strategy of curating library that covers a wide range of decades. The significant increase in content availability from the 2000s onwards suggests a concerted effort to offer a diverse selection of titles. This collection spanning multiple decades allows Netflix's audience to explore a variety of movies and shows that reflect different eras. 

## 3. How did age-certifications impact the dataset?

ROUND(AVG(imdb_score),2) AS avg_imdb_score,
ROUND(AVG(tmdb_score),2) AS avg_tmdb_score
FROM shows_movies.titles
GROUP BY age_certification
ORDER BY avg_imdb_score DESC
```
